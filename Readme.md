The bot recognizes commands in the channel it's a member of (Jamie's flat) when they are preceded by an !. The bot will then execute the command, and respond in the channel with an outcome. the Cheese Wheel will ignore all private messages. For example... !help will print the command list in the channel for everyone to see. That command list is also here on the page, but in the event I forget to update this, the one the bot has is most up to date.

The game is not meant to be a replacement for RP, but an enhancement to it and a bit of a challenge for a players improvisation skills. Any game impacting action costs energy. Energy is gained by making roleplaying posts. Basically anything that is preceded by /me is considered a post. In the future there may be limits on how fast you can generate energy, or how long a post needs to be to yield energy. Today all roleplay posts generate energy up to a max of 3.

In an ideal scenario you are making at least one roleplaying post between each command you execute. But for slower games you may only execute a command after a long interaction between characters. I'm happy to support playful semi-ooc play with short posts, but be respectful of your partners by taking roleplay seriously and not optimizing for the bot.

# Alias

If your name has a space in it, you must use the setalias command once to give yourself a nickname with no spaces. For example, the below adds an alias for the bots owner so that Jamie can be used to address her in the game.

!setalias Jamie Jamie Benett

Jamie Benett becomes Jamie. But JamieB or JamieBenett would also have been acceptable.

Aliases can also be used to reframe the context of the game by remapping commands to new keywords. For example, updating seduce to attack will give the game a more traditional combat feel, while updating dominate to swallow can serve vore scenarios.

# Resolve

Resolve is the main stat representing the current standing of a player in the game. When you roll dice in competition with another player, you roll a number of dice equal to how much resolve your character has, your result is the highest result of the rolled dice. A character can have between 0 and 3 resolve.

Successfully using the seduce command on another character, will lower their resolve by one stage. This causes a spiral effect where a character starts to gain a disadvantage, and then they are more likely to lose future contests unless their resolve is restored.

Resolve can be recovered with the rest command. Though, there is only a 1/2 chance of successfully recovering a resolve when using it. While disadvantaged, it's not a great idea but good for mitigating risk while your ahead or one player has already been dominated.

# Dominate

The 'objective' of the game is to roleplay and have fun. But you could say that the closest thing to a win condition for the game is to have one's opponent dominated. The Dominate command is a contest like seduce, however, successfully dominating a character puts them in a dominated status. Dominated characters cannot interact with any other character who isn't also dominated by the same person. (In a vore scenario, this would be because the dominated character is inside the predator character, but otherwise it's simply because they are in the control of the dom).

While dominated, you can use energy to struggle. The struggle command has a 1/6 chance of success. Upon success, the dominated status is removed.

# Disclaimer

I can make no guarantee's behind this code. I followed the f-chat rules and protocol to the best of my ability, and in some cases gave the bot even more strict requirements than f-chat demands. It should be able to interact safely with f-chat. If you run your own version of this bot, be sure to read the f-chat rules regarding bots and only join this bot to a private channel that you own.
